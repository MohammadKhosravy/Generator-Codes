# Generator-Codes
On this page, the generator codes for the paper "Benchmarking for Robust Discrete Optimization Problems" by Marc Goerigk and Mohammad Khosravi can be found, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04985v1


Instruction of using generator codes:

Each folder contains three files named main.cpp, selection.cpp and sel.h. The main.cpp file introduces the input parameters. The selection.cpp file consists of all the function we used and the sel file.h, has all the classes. The input parameters are different for each problem. Therefore, they are described for all combination of problems as follows:

1. MIN-MAX PROBLEM WITH DISCRETE UNCERTAINTY SET:

2. MIN-MAX PROBLEM WITH BUDGETED UNCERTAINTY SET:

3. MIN-MAX REGRET PROBLEM WITH DISCRETE UNCERTAINTY SET:

4. MIN-MAX REGRET PROBLEM WITH INTERVAL UNCERTAINTY SET:

5. TWO-STAGE PROBLEM WITH DISCRETE UNCERTAINTY SET:

6. TWO-STAGE PROBLEM WITH DISCRETE BUDGETED UNCERTAINTY SET:

7. TWO-STAGE PROBLEM WITH CONTINUOUS BUDGETED UNCERTAINTY SET:

8. RECOVERABLE PROBLEM WITH DISCRETE UNCERTAINTY SET:

9. RECOVERABLE PROBLEM WITH DISCRETE BUDGETED UNCERTAINTY SET:

10. RECOVERABLE PROBLEM WITH CONTINUOUS BUDGETED UNCERTAINTY SET:
